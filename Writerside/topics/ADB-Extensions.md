# ADB Extensions

These are the extensions that I commonly used for ADB, this is used to connect to the robot over wifi.

The disconnect extension is used to disconnect from the robot, this is useful if you are connected to multiple robots and want to switch between them. Or if you plan on turning off the robot, you should disconnect from it first.

The kill-server extension is used to kill the ADB server if you need to reset it. This is useful if you are having issues with ADB and need to reset it.
